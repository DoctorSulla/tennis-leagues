When generating new Rust projects I found myself spending a lot of
time adding similar crates and writing boilerplate so have created this repository as
a template for web applications to reduce the amount of time I spend rewriting the same thing
over and over again. This is still very much a work in progress but I intend to
make improvements to it over time as my Rust knowledge improves and I discover the pain points of my initial attempt.
